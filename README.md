## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Through this project, I improved my skills in **flexbox layout**, **CSS transitions**, and **semantic HTML** structuring. Here are some highlights:

```css
.btn {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: 700;
  padding: 10px;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin: 5px 0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
```

This CSS snippet demonstrates how I used transitions to create smooth hover effects and improved button aesthetics with rounded corners.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue refining my **responsive design** techniques and explore more advanced CSS features like **grid layouts** and **animations**.
